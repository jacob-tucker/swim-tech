        <p>
          In this section, we will talk about all the techniques behind the sport of swimming.
          This will include the 4 main strokes used at a competetive level.

        <p className="section-header">What are the swimming techniques?</p>
        <p>
          In swimming, there are 4 different official techniques that are known both for recreational and
          (primarily) for competetive purposes. The 4 consist of Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke,
          and Butterfly. Each of these is very unique, and being good at one does not imply being good
          at the others. In addition, each of them is very different in how they race, each of which
          will be described below.
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Freestyle</p>
        <p>
          Freestyle is by far the most popular stroke in swimming, and the fastest. When you learn
          to swim, the first stroke you learn to do is freestyle because of its simplicity. Because
          of this, it is also the most competetive stroke and SUPER fun to watch because the best swimmers
          in the world fly through the water at incredible speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of its popularity and high competetiveness, it also consists of the widest variety
          of events. Swimmers compete in just 1 lap, 2 laps, 4 laps, 8 laps, and many more up to even
          25 laps. The reason is because with freestyle, you can more easily pace the effort you
          put in, and go longer distances. And of course because there are a lot of people who perform
          this stroke, so they need a lot of events for people who are good at different types of races
          (whether that be long or short distance).
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform the stroke, you swim with your stomach facing the bottom of the pool and pull yourself
          with your arms while kicking with your feet. To breathe, you turn your head to the side
          and rest it on your arm. Below is a video of me explaining how Freestyle works.

        <p className="section-header">Backstroke</p>
        <p>
          Backstroke is the third fastest. As indicated by the name, it is swum on your back, which
          usually scares many swimmers away. It is also the only stroke where you can breathe the whole 
          time you're doing it because your head is out of the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backstroke is also interesting because it's the one stroke where you can't see the wall when you
          swim up to it in order to turn around and swim back. With the other 3, you can simply touch the wall 
          and turn around, but with backstroke, competetive swimmers have to have an exact count of pulls
          to take before flipping over and pushing off the wall again.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform the stroke, you swim on your back and pull yourself using your arms while kicking with
          your feet. If you ever flip over to your stomach (except for turns), you immediately get disqualified. 
          Below is a video of me explaining how Backstroke works.
        </p>

        <p className="section-header">Breaststroke</p>
        <p>
          Breaststroke is the slowest and most relaxing stroke. It is the second most popular behind 
          Freestyle because it is used everywhere recreationally. It does not require that much effort,
          and is often described as being the easiest physically. Most older swimmers perform Freestyle or 
          Breaststroke because you can do them for a long time without getting too tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaststroke's kick is the most unique of the 4. Unlike freestyle, backstroke, or butterfly 
          where your legs never really separate from a parallel line, your kick in breaststroke is similar
          to a frog's. It allows you to propel forward in one motion rather than a constant one.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform this stroke, you swim with your stomach at a slight angle facing the bottom of the pool.
          You do the stroke in cycles where you push your head underwater, kick and pull with your arms at the 
          same time, and then bring your head above water, and repeat the cycle. Below is a video of me 
          explaining how Breaststroke works.
        </p>

        <p className="section-header">Butterfly</p>
        <p>
          Butterfly is the hardest and most tiring stroke (and my personal FAVOURITE). It is extremely
          tiring to perform, so much so that there don't exist any long distance events for this stroke.
          It is also the most fun to watch as swimmers propel themselves through the water like dolphins, 
          and it requires an incredible amount of skill and physical prowess. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform this stroke, you swim with your stomach facing the bottom of the pool.
          You swim almost like a dolphin; Your legs never seperate or you get immediately disqualified,
          so imagine you're legs are like a mermaids. You can only flap them in the water. For your arms,
          you move them together or you get disqualified as well. You swing them up and out of the water,
          and then back into the water in front of you. Below is a video of me 
          explaining how Butterfly works.
