        <h2>Techniques of Swimming</h2>
        <p className="section-header">Introduction</p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will talk about all the different technologies that power
          swimmers at both a recreational and competitive level.

        <p className="section-header">Necessary Technologies</p>
        <p>
          There are some technologies in swimming that are absolutely essential if you
          wish to dive in and get swimming. Two of those are goggles and a swim suit.
        </p>
        <img src="/goggles.jpg" alt="swimming goggles" />
        <p>
          Although it may be super obvious, goggles and a swimming suit are needed to 
          get in the water. Goggles are the piece of equipment you wear to keep water out
          of your eyes, and picking the right ones are really important! Recreationally, 
          picking goggles that keep the water out of your eyes is most important so you 
          stay comfortable in the water. In competitive swimming however, you also need 
          to worry about how tight the goggles are so you decrease water resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see in the picture above that the swimmer's goggles unfortunately fell
          off during their race. Sometimes, it's not even the swimmer's fault, and is just
          terrible luck. It basically ruins the race, because you can't in front of you,
          the other swimmers, and it slows you down through water resistance. However,
          you can see they are tight to her face, which all competitive swimmers do.
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Common Technologies</p>
        <img src="/swimcap.jpg" width="400" alt="swimming cap" />
        <p>
          Some technologies in swimming aren't essential, but come super in handy (whether it 
          be for practice, exercise, or racing) and are seen very often. One of those is a swim
          cap. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A swim cap is something you wear over your head to keep your hair contained. The reasons for this
          are: <br /><br />
          <b>1.</b> It allows you to go faster due to decreased water resistance <br />
          <b>2.</b> Allows you to put less effort into your swim due to decreased water resistance <br />
          <b>3.</b> Allows you to have greater visibility in the water <br />
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Assumptions in Technologies</p>
        <p>
          Danielle Obe, a founding member of the Black swimming association, 
          mentions even the technologies behind swimming (like caps) are designed for caucasian swimmers. 
          Swim caps are not designed to fit the Afro hairstyle, which makes it very difficult for Black 
          swimmers to take advantage of the technology (Walker).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is worth bringing up because as we learn about technologies in the space,
          we must be aware of their assumptions in design practices. If we wish to encourage
          an inclusive, fun, competetitve, and amazing sport, we should do our best to challenge
          assumptions in technology and develop greater ones.
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Training/Exercise Technologies</p>
        <p>
          There are tons and tons of technologies in swimming used for training and physical exercise.
          Thus, all of the technologies listed below are used both recreationally and competitively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>KICKBOARDS</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Kickboards are a little floatation device that allow you to put your arms on and keep
          the front half of your body afloat. These are great for training your legs, because 
          the only way to move forward is to kick.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FLIPPERS</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Flippers are a part of every competitive swimmer's routine and allow you to do so many
          things when swimming. They are little fins you put on your feet to make you swim
          a lot faster. Here are some other added benefits of using flippers: <br /><br />
          <b>1.</b> Take stress off of shoulders - because you usually do so much workout on your shoulders,
          they can get tired and hurt after a while. Flippers put all the pressure into your legs,
          so your shoulders do less of the work. <br />
          <b>2.</b> Improve kick technique - because most of the pressure is now on your legs, it allows
          you to focus on the lower part of your body and improving your kicking technique. <br />
          <b>3.</b> Improve overall technique - because your body is moving a lot faster, your body naturally
          rises to the surface and swims on top of the water. This means you can focus on the actual
          technique of your upper body without worrying about all the pressure put on your muscles.
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Swim Wearables</p>
        <p>
          There are quite a few technologies meant to help improve your stroke, but they are a bit 
          more complex than a simple kickboard or flippers. The reason is because they require equipping
          something to your body to get a more deep understanding of how you're swimming.
        </p>
        <img src="/swimpaddle.jpg" width="400" alt="swim paddle technology" />
        <p>
          <b>SMARTPADDLE</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          "SmartPaddle" is one such sports wearable where you equip a sensor to your fingers while 
          you swim.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned on their <a href="https://simplifaster.com/articles/swim-faster-smartpaddle-sensor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a>, "SmartPaddle is a wearable sensor that measures the force, speed, and orientation of your 
          swimming strokes. It shows whether the swimmer can apply the right amount of 
          force in the right direction at the right time."
        </p>
        <p>
          More simply, the technology connects and sends information about the swimmer to a mobile 
          device. That way, the swimmer doesn't have to worry about the device while they swim,
          but can look at the information after.
        </p>
        <p>
          One interesting part of sports wearables with swimming if you have to make sure not to impact 
          the hydrodynamics of the swimmer too heavily. Luckily, the SmartPaddle doesn't effect a swimmer's
          technique enough to make a big difference on the time.
