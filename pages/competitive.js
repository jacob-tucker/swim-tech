          When swimmming at a competitive level, there are a lot of added quirks that go into a race.
          This section will describe the immense amounts of technology that goes into swimming competetitvely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CUPPING</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Cupping is a piece of technology used all the time at competitive levels. 
          Cupping is a process where you place round glass suction cups on sore parts of the body. The
          reason for this is because it increases blood flow to certain aprts of your body, prepping your
          muscles for a race so they aren't stiff. It can also help to relieve pain in certain areas.
        </p> 
        <p>
          <b>DOUBLE CAPS</b>
        </p>
        <img src="/swim cap.webp" width="400" alt="double swimming cap" />
        <p>
          This one is pretty self explanatory, but you can see that some swimmers actually like to
          put two caps on during their race. This is to squeeze their head extra tight during a race.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>TIGHT SUITS</b>
        </p>
        <img src="/olympicswimming.jpg" width="400" alt="really tight suits at the olympics" />
        <p>
          Similarly to double capping, it is pretty easy to understand why swimmers might wear extremely
          tight suits. They want to make sure their body enters and glides through the water at an optimal
          pace. Remember back to our lesson on hydrodynamics! Swimmers want to make sure there is as 
          little water resistance as possible. Even a few seconds off your time can win you a world record.
