          <b>CUPPING</b>

        <p>
          Cupping is a piece of technology used all the time at competitive levels. 
          Cupping is a process where you place round glass suction cups on sore parts of the body. The
          reason for this is because it increases blood flow to certain aprts of your body, prepping your
          muscles for a race so they aren't stiff. It can also help to relieve pain in certain areas.
        </p> 
        <p>
          <b>DOUBLE CAPS</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          This one is pretty self explanatory, but you can see that some swimmers actually like to
          put two caps on during their race. This is to squeeze their head extra tight during a race.
