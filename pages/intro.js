        <h2>Introduction to Swimming</h2>
        <p className="section-header">Introduction</p>
        <p>
          In this section, we will briefly introduce swimming as both a sport and a
          leisure activity for all. In addition, we will provide a historial background of the sport.

        <p className="section-header">History</p>
        <p>A formal summary of swimming can be defined as follows: <i>"swimming, in recreation and sports,
          the propulsion of the body through water by combined arm and leg motions and the natural
          flotation of the body. Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around body developer
          and is particularly useful in therapy and as exercise for physically handicapped persons.
          It is also taught for lifesaving purposes." (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/swimming-sport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a>)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies have shown that the act of swimming may have been introduced as early as 2500 BCE
          starting in Egypt. Although, some think that a lack of swimming during that era is attributed
          to a disbelief that diseases and other epidemics spread through pools.

          Swimming began to be used as a form of water therapy in the late 17th century. It was not until
          the 19th century that is became popular as both a sport and recreational activity. The first ever
          swimming championship was held in Australia in 1846, and it was a 400-metre race (will be described
          in the next lesson). Then, in 1896, swimming was introduced into the Olympics and has increased
          in popularity ever since. Although, it was initially only for men, and womens swimming was later
          added to the Olympics in 1912.
        </p>
        <p className="section-header">Discrimination in Swimming</p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, swimming has not always been equal for all. Beginning in the with
          discrimination based on sex between 1986-1912, womens swimming was not an official Olympic sport.

          In addition, it is very clear that swimming education is lacking at a young age, 
          especially for Black people. One of the only Black swimmers I knew as a kid was a friend 
          of mine since elementary school, and he constantly told me about how difficult it was 
          to convince his parents to let him swim as opposed to other sports. In addition, he felt 
          uncomfortable when competing because it was such a heavily white-dominated sport. 
          Danielle Obe, a founding member of the Black swimming association, mentions even the 
          technologies behind swimming (like caps) are designed for caucasian swimmers. Swim caps 
          are not designed to fit the Afro hairstyle, which makes it very difficult for Black swimmers 
          to take advantage of the technology (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/04/i-was-the-only-black-kid-in-the-pool-why-swimming-is-so-white" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Walker</a>).
